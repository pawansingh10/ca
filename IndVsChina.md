---

- We compare India to China and China Compare China to USA, i.e not right compare ourselve to the yesterday
- | India                         | China             |
  | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | Democratic                    | Autocratic        |
  | Multi Political Parties Rules | Single party Rule |
  | Proper Elected Government     | Not like us       |

- In the current moment, it is important to be clear why comparisions with China are not only specious but also dangerous

- [x] China's development pathway over the last century has been **spectacular बहुत शानदार**
- [x] No country in history has ever grown faster and more dynamically

  - **Not Only havr Hundreds of millions been lifted out of poverty**
  - **Social Indicateors have improved dramatically**

- [x] India's development record has been much more fixed

  - Since the 1990s, the Indian Economy **has grown impressively**
  - But remains far behind China in its **Global Competitiveness**

  - **Poverty** has come down but like China
  - But **Employement** prospects for the majority remains limited
  - Basic **Social Development** indicators have logged

- Reason Behind this for develoment of any Country
- Sectors in Economic Sector

1. **Primary Sectors**

- Agriculture

2. **Secondary Sectors**

- Manufacturing
- **With different skill required but not like service sector skills**
- Construction
- Manufacturing Product
- **Not Required too much skill, without skills person also survive**

3. **Tertiary Sectors**

- Service
- **Skill Labour Force used in Service Sector**
- Teaching who have knowledge
- Lawer who have proper literate in Laws
- Doctor who have degree & proper Knowledge
- Engineers
- Governmet Employees

  > Not who are not study properly become this

- Our country developing in order to Primary rather than the Manufacturing we jumped to the Service Sector
- That means we imports ready made things directly impacts the Employement because Manufacturing Provides Maximum Job
- China is strong at Manufacturing Level even they have major population they handle it
- India's present Administration try to do so like **Make in India** these schemes success but the impact we want not completed
- So We have still gain growth but i.e from Servive sector that's is one reason for unemployement in our country

- Actually, India is behind from Banladesh & Pakistan in many indicators, Our Hunger Index is less than Pak

- **Too Democratic** - India's problem is that it is just too democratic unlike China making & implementing key decisions about

  - **Public Investment**

  1.  If anyone want to invest in China, China's land is hand of his government they alloted land within quick time Porject Plant and Invest in it
  2.  It is not possible in India, In Democracy Protests started like Land Acquisition Act, 3 Bill related to farmers

  - **various Reforms** is impossible in the din of multiple & Contradictory democratic voices

- What require?

  - Firmer and more independent forms of decision making related to development

- It is especially important to be clear why comparisons with China are very danger

- China, with a history of State Building going back 2 millennia(a period of thousand years)
  - An exceptionally well-organised
  - Disciplined
  - Brutal form of authoritarianism
  - Has done especially well in transforming its economy
- We can't say democracy only back us because democracy like Japan, South Coria, USA etc are developed, yes democracy make cause in delay of decision

- Africa & West Asia, like Iran, Iraq etc where authoritarian government even though remain Economically backward

- The Latin American Military dictatorships of the 1960-1970s has a terrible economic

- Compare India & Pak has authoriterian Military govennment even they are economically behind

- In India, states of south India performing well while north states like UP , Bihar & Jharkhand not going well.
- So main thing is that **policy implementation, Social security, Health, Education** these things matter in economics
