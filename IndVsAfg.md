## India, Afganistan and USA
***

- **U.S Military & 36 NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) country Forces** decided to leave Afg.
- Biden set a deadline of 11th Sept 2021, because **"20 years anniversary of 9/11 attack"**

### Why they leave Afghanistan?
- ~20 years passed i.e as mark of respect or accomplish thier objectives & made Afg free from terrorism even that is not the case Tabilan & Al-Qaeda is still there~
- Al-Qaeda roots still there and Pak based afflied terror group is operating in Afg
- Ofcourse they killed Osama Bin Laden But they killed him in 2011 if that was the goal they should have left 1 or 2 years after that
- There cased is there:- 
  - [x] Finish thier Objectives
  - [x] US has lost the battle
  - [x] Ending terrorism was never their goal
   > U.S Forces have left **Bagram** airbase at night without informing Afg Commander does not seems professional

- American invested so much on **Bagram** is biggest airfield in Afg & epic center of War against Taliban and Al-Qaeda after 9/11 attacks

- Reports says, After US Forces leave the way in nights & early morning that Military bases was looted infacts there are reports that says 1000 of vehicles, weapons and
  other military items are fallen in hands of Taliban
  - That's shows America is helping Taliban indirectly
  - If taliban is enemy of America from last 20 years  this kind of acts telling different kind of story
  > **You can't leave a property without a proper hand-over** 
  - Something fishy about all of this

### Personally I'm Not a Big Fan of US Forces
- The way they glorify themself in movies, It is an **illusion**
- Purely a Marketing tectics, They relie on **Narrative Building**
- After all they self made a global image of **World Savier**
- America has been doing **Information Warfare** since World War-II
  - US has control over global media as well as the internet
  - They have media outlet in all over globe almost all country to story, article, opinions, books, movies, drama etc
   - That is how they get the power to create stories, hide the truth, exagerrate the truth or dillute the truth as per thier need and made narratives
   - Intellectuals and Educated people are hired by these big Media outlets with the help of right words
   - That will have drastic affect on Human Emotions & Feelings and Become sole custody of Democracy in World
   - Even use same tool to destablised any country
  
### Something Fishy, Why USA came Afg?
- **1990, Begining of America endless War in the Middle East**

- **USSR collapes in 1991**

- **Before 1947 to 1999, Cold war**
  - After World War-II ended, Cold War between USSR Vs USA started
  - World became Bipolar
  - During Cold War, **U.S** was based on **Capitalism & Democracy** while **USSR** i.e Soviet Union was based on **Communism & Dictatorship**
  - That's why the end of Cold War is often viewed as a Victory of United States Democracy over Soviet Union Dictatorship
  
- **Taliban emerged in 1994**
 
- **U.S attack Afg after 9/11 attacks 2001**
  - Under U.S President **George Bush** officially announce War on Terror
  - **Osama Bin laden** was the mastermind of 9/11 attacks, who is founder of **Al-Qaeda**
  - So **Taliban** was not enemy of America i.e, **Al-Qaeda** but blamed on both terrorist group by ameican media, but truth is Taliban was not envolved in 9/11 attcks
  - **Al-Qaeda** was founded in 1980 as biproduct of **Soviet Afghan War (1978-1989)** 
  
  - **Anti-Communist islamic Afghans** begins to like **Soviet Intervention** which was stared because of assasiantion of **Nur Mohammad Taraki** in 1979(influence leader by USSR)
   - They did not had any training, weapons or support from any country
   - USA carefully watching this situation
   - USA started support Afghans against USSR, But why?
    - **1954-1973 Vietnam War**, China had become communist in 1949
    - **1971 Ind-Pak War** for Bangladesh Liberation War
     - To revenge of War, Pak launch the **Khalistan Movement** against India, **K2 Mission** K1 is Kashmir & K2 is Khalistan
   - Although Pak worried about **Soviet Union** intervention in Afg but they were focus to taking revenge from Ind, US get involve in **Soviet-Afgan War**
    - Zyaul Haq (Army President after assasination of Bhutto) clever man came up with plan and meet with US president 
    - Offer to help US against USSR after Vietnam loss,
    - They also can get money from US
    - That is how **Operation Cyclone** started
    - CIA gives funds and weapons to **Mujahideen Fighters** in Afghanistan through Pakistan
    - Pakistan played role of middle man, because USA didn't wanted directly invovled with USSR
    - By the way Pak use this money and funds against Ind to train militants for K1 & K2 mission
    - Pak wanted to kill **2 birds with 1 stone**
    - USA can't fly directly to Afg, Pak provide land root by which arms & weapons supply to mujahideen fighters in Afg
    - So much money & weapons come in, **Pak Army & ISI** even creates many rivals groups in Afg
    - They recriuted **Mujahidees** from all over the world specially from Islamic Countries
    - Pak created a **Religious Militancy** and turned it into business
   
 - **Afg was divided politically from inside**
  - **1. Isalmic Group used to support communism** back by Soviet Forces
  - **2. Radical Islamic Group** i.e, Mujahideen trained & supported by Pak Army with the help of US
  - This was going on almost for 10 years, **Soviet-Afg War** ended in **1989**
  - USSR pull backs its troops and abandon the mission in Afg, **by 1991 USSR Collapse**
  - Now Mujahideen needed to only fight with thier own people with different ideology, So there is no terror business for Pak
  - US stops funding Pak, big loss of Pak Army
  - **Al-Qeada headed by Osama, Mujahideens was brain washed** by Pak to fight against Corrupt islamic leaders and US presence in Islamic land
  - That was the time US wanted to thier ***presence in Middle East***
  
 - **1991 Gulf War, USA looks thiers benefits**
   - Coalition Forces from 35 nations led by **United states** against **Iraq** Oil pricing and Production Disputes
   - **Saddam Hussein** regime was became America first target in 1990s
   - Pak shown this an opportunities and  created **Al-Qaeda**
   - ***1996 when Pak Army created Taliban***, **Al-Qaeda** restablish its headquarter in Afg under the shadow of Taliban
   - 1997-1998, Al-Qaeda influence started expanding in African County\
    - US Ambecy attack in kenya and Tanjania, done by Al-Qaeda
   - Finally **9/11 attcks** happened US declared war on terror and took Al-Qaeda seriously
   - Pak sucessed to bring back USA in Afgan, this time directly by sending troops

   - If you sees the interview of Parvez Musaraf, he openly admitted that Pak Army & ISI had trained the Taliban and Al-Qaeda
    - Also said Osama Bin laden, Hakkami etc were heroes for Pak & CIA also
  
 ### Pak K1 mission Kashmir
- Militancy started in J&K in late 80s & early 90s that was the time of end of Soviet-Afg war
- It was Pak Army & ISI who created **Lashkar-e-Taiba**, **Jaish-e-Mohahmmad** etc these are nothing but affliated with **Al-Qaeda** & **Taliban**
- Pak Army & ISI are responsible to created **Riligious Militancy**
- They order them to do **Jihaad in kashmir** in the name of religion
- After analysing **Pakistan is the founding father of all this** but even **United States have to blamed for all this** after all they supplied Money & Equipments etc

> So, **Terrorism is the creation of both Pakistan as well as the indirect involvement of the West**\
> **Noone says and admits it openely but ultimately This is the Truth**


###  2021 Afghan
- American did not came to Afg to finish terrorism, Yes they did kill Osama Bin Laden not finished terrorism
- They had some other Agenda, Do you even believe that CIA  does not know who Created & trained Taliban & Al-Qaeda
- Ameican very well known its Pakistan, still they were taking  help Pak giving aid, technology, arms everything
- Bill Quinton, George Bush, Obama during there presedency everyone signs deals and aids to Pak only Trump was differnt That's why I beleive that Trumph was better USA as well as for India

- For 20 years **Taliban Fighters** took shelter in Northern Afghanistan
- The American had Military Base, Taliban used to hide in mountains & cave
 - This is the reason US Forces do Airstrikes in these mountains areas
 - Many movies made on last 20 years on Afgan-USA war, it is all part of narrative building
 - By these means US create a image of global savier

- That does not means Taliban & Al-Qaeda are innocents, yes they are responsible for many atrocities but then we also have to blame those who are responsible for the creation of these terror outfields

- After 20 years **Talibani becomes experience fighters and smart**, They have also learnt **Diplomacy**
  - They also realize that if they want to **survive in this world** they need to focus on **Stablishing a government**  

- The idea of Withdrawing forces from Afghanistan started during the time of Brack Obama in 2015
  - Infact Obama Administration is the first who send the representative to meet with the Taliban Leader (including Afghan Govt)
  - Meeting was held in Marin Pakistan
  - Meeting was not successful later Trump also appointed a special envoy for Afghanistan to directly negociate with Taliban in 2020 (exclude Afghan Govt)
  
  - This shows 2 cased
   - [x] Either US Govt scared of Taliban
   - [x] Or May be they had made some deal with Taliban & that deal is confidential that's why they didn't envolve Afghan Govt
   > By the way Taliban does not recognise Afghan Govt

### USA fight over 20 Years, Now make a piece deal with Taliban
- US wanted Taliban to stop Violence
- Reduce hostilities against Foreign Troops
- Join Intra-Afghan Peace talks 
- Cut all ties with Foreign Terrorists groups
- **And USA withdraws all its troops**

- After the agreement was sign US told the Afghan Govt to release thousands(5000) of Taliban prisoners which was one of the condition of Taliban to start peace talks

- **So, Two reason to USA withdraw**
> USA become suddenly **Elder brother of Taliban**
  - **USA wanted a face Saving Exit**
   - Making it like a peace deal so that they can get out of Afg 
   - They exhausted fighting the Taliban from past 20 years

  - **Taliaban is going through a change of Heart**
   - May be they finally realize that fighting is not a good option
   - They turn into peaceful sole
   - And It took 20 years to USA to make realize them Taliban  

### Afghan Govt - Asraf Gunny & Indian Government
- Alone fighting the Taliban
- Every day that certain percentage of country is being  taken over by Taliban
- That is also the reason why Ind Govt is also holding secret talk directly with Taliban leaders not with the Afghan Govt

### Pak-Taliban in 2021
- Now USA is leaving& Taliban is advancing Pakistan again in the spotlight
- Pak thinks that 20-30 years back the had trained & created Al-Qaeda and Taliban
- So somehow if Taliban take over Afghan then it will **serve Pakistan Interests**
- Taliban is also aware of Pak double standards
  - After 9/11 attacks Pak played a double game
  - One hand shelter Taliban Leaders
  - Other hand also taking money from USA
- Recently 11 Pakistani Soldiers were killed by Tahrike Taliban in Khaibar Pakhtoon Province

- Taliban does not recognize **Durand line** even entire Afghan denied it

- **Pashtuns** are afghan people, they are 25% of Pak Population and 2nd ethic group in pak
- **Taliban are Pashtuns**, speak **pashto**, pashtun nationalism is very deep rooted in them
- Infact the whole **border issues between Afghan and Pak regarding Durand line** is based on **Pashtun Nationalism**
- Talibanies are changed not same like 1990s, if they came in power they also concern about border

- **Pashtun & Baloch Nationalism** are problems of Pak Army
  - Pak Army persuited them for decades

- Islamic Religion Card is not working for Pakistan

- Taliban very well knows that the Parvez Mussaraf has send more than 4000 Militants to the USA by putting tag of Al-Qaeda & Taliban in exchange of Money and Commission

### China-Taliban 2021
- Look at Map, China has very small border line with Afghanistan
- China is not interested in making enemy out of Taliban
- But in Afghan Population 2 types of ideology exists
 - **Taliban (Islamic Sharia Followers)**
 - **Afghan Gvt(Islamic democrate liberal marxist)**

- Both of them are nationalist but thier political ideologies are different
  - This could also be reason behind USA withdraw
  - It's difficult for USA to be in middle of two different political ideologies
 
- **Political Settlement between Taliban & Afghan Govt**
  - India and China see situation very carefully
  - Both country also willing to hold talk with Afghan Govt as well as Taliban
 
- China does not have to depend on Pakistan's PoK region to gain entry into Afghanistan

### Ind-Narsigha rao Govt
- India is fine dealing with both Taliban & Afghan Govt
- Of course, Any Civil Govt would love to deal with another civil govt however Ind also deal with Taliban
- Back in 80s and 90s, Few Mujahideen Commander had meeted covert ties between Indian Intelligence Agencies even during Soviet Era under Narsigha Rao leadership
- Narsigha Rao was the first Indian Govt that had reached out to Mujahideen Govt and started building strong relationship with leaders
- India used to provide medical and humaterian supplies

### Strategic Importance of Afghan for Ind as well as China
- China is interested to building roadways between Peshawat to Kabul that would make kabul China Belt & Road Initiatives
- India does not want that
- Afghan Govt is very friendly with Ind, Taliban can take side with India when it come to Nationalism
- But there is also regious cart, Taliban is basically followers of **Sunni Islams** and they are 100% advocate of Sharia Law that is what make them extremist and redical
- For India it is difficult to negotiate with them
- For China there is another problem, **Uyghus Muslims in China**
  - China also has threat to national security if Taliban come to power
  - After all Taliban want to implement Shariya
  - Religious Militancy can also turn around heavy for Chinese even India has same problem

- India has concern what if pakistan again manipulate Taliban in shifting their focus on **kashmir**
  - Just like they did in 80s & 90s

### USA cunning Step
- When USA leave, there will be curios in this region
- They know CHINA, INDIA, PAK & Taliban fight against each other
- But the nature of USA is they cannot sit ideal they have to be part of some curios only then can maintain image of Savier
- US will still interfare may be in different way
- May be they are looking for another conflicts zone in the world where they can repeat thier narratives

> **The Geo-Politics of India Subcontinent is going to be interesting in upcoming**
