## India, Afganistan and USA
***

- **U.S Military & 36 NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) country Forces** decided to leave Afg.
- Biden set a deadline of 11th Sept 2021, because **"20 years anniversary of 9/11 attack"**

### Why they leave Afghanistan?
- ~20 years passed i.e as mark of respect or accomplish thier objectives & made Afg free from terrorism even that is not the case Tabilan & Al-Qaeda is still there~
- Al-Qaeda roots still there and Pak based afflied terror group is operating in Afg
- Ofcourse they killed Osama Bin Laden But they killed him in 2011 if that was the goal they should have left 1 or 2 years after that
- There cased is there:- 
  - [x] Finish thier Objectives
  - [x] US has lost the battle
  - [x] Ending terrorism was never their goal
   > U.S Forces have left **Bagram** airbase at night without informing Afg Commander does not seems professional

- American invested so much on **Bagram** is biggest airfield in Afg & epic center of War against Taliban and Al-Qaeda after 9/11 attacks

- Reports says, After US Forces leave the way in nights & early morning that Military bases was looted infacts there are reports that says 1000 of vehicles, weapons and
  other military items are fallen in hands of Taliban
  - That's shows America is helping Taliban indirectly
  - If taliban is enemy of America from last 20 years  this kind of acts telling different kind of story
  > **You can't leave a property without a proper hand-over** 
  - Something fishy about all of this

### Personally I'm Not a Big Fan of US Forces
- The way they glorify themself in movies, It is an **illusion**
- Purely a Marketing tectics, They relie on **Narrative Building**
- After all they self made a global image of **World Savier**
- America has been doing **Information Warfare** since World War-II
  - US has control over global media as well as the internet
  - They have media outlet in all over globe almost all country to story, article, opinions, books, movies, drama etc
   - That is how they get the power to create stories, hide the truth, exagerrate the truth or dillute the truth as per thier need and made narratives
   - Intellectuals and Educated people are hired by these big Media outlets with the help of right words
   - That will have drastic affect on Human Emotions & Feelings and Become sole custody of Democracy in World
   - Even use same tool to destablised any country
  
### Something Fishy, Why USA came Afg?
- **1990, Begining of America endless War in the Middle East**

- **USSR collapes in 1991**

- **Before 1947 to 1999, Cold war**
  - After World War-II ended, Cold War between USSR Vs USA started
  - World became Bipolar
  - During Cold War, **U.S** was based on **Capitalism & Democracy** while **USSR** i.e Soviet Union was based on **Communism & Dictatorship**
  - That's why the end of Cold War is often viewed as a Victory of United States Democracy over Soviet Union Dictatorship
  
- **Taliban emerged in 1994**
 
- **U.S attack Afg after 9/11 attacks 2001**
  - Under U.S President **George Bush** officially announce War on Terror
  - **Osama Bin laden** was the mastermind of 9/11 attacks, who is founder of **Al-Qaeda**
  - So **Taliban** was not enemy of America i.e, **Al-Qaeda** but blamed on both terrorist group by ameican media, but truth is Taliban was not envolved in 9/11 attcks
  - **Al-Qaeda** was founded in 1980 as biproduct of **Soviet Afghan War (1978-1989)** 
  
  - **Anti-Communist islamic Afghans** begins to like **Soviet Intervention** which was stared because of assasiantion of **Nur Mohammad Taraki** in 1979(influence leader by USSR)
   - They did not had any training, weapons or support from any country
   - USA carefully watching this situation
   - USA started support Afghans against USSR, But why?
    - **1954-1973 Vietnam War**, China had become communist in 1949
    - **1971 Ind-Pak War** for Bangladesh Liberation War
     - To revenge of War, Pak launch the **Khalistan Movement** against India, **K2 Mission** K1 is Kashmir & K2 is Khalistan
   - Although Pak worried about **Soviet Union** intervention in Afg but they were focus to taking revenge from Ind, US get involve in **Soviet-Afgan War**
    - Zyaul Haq (Army President after assasination of Bhutto) clever man came up with plan and meet with US president 
    - Offer to help US against USSR after Vietnam loss,
    - They also can get money from US
    - That is how **Operation Cyclone** started
    - CIA gives funds and weapons to **Mujahideen Fighters** in Afghanistan through Pakistan
    - Pakistan played role of middle man, because USA didn't wanted directly invovled with USSR
    - By the way Pak use this money and funds against Ind to train militants for K1 & K2 mission
    - Pak wanted to kill **2 birds with 1 stone**
    - USA can't fly directly to Afg, Pak provide land root by which arms & weapons supply to mujahideen fighters in Afg
    - So much money & weapons come in, **Pak Army & ISI** even creates many rivals groups in Afg
    - They recriuted **Mujahidees** from all over the world specially from Islamic Countries
    - Pak created a **Religious Militancy** and turned it into business
   
 - **Afg was divided politically from inside**
  - **1. Isalmic Group used to support communism** back by Soviet Forces
  - **2. Radical Islamic Group** i.e, Mujahideen trained & supported by Pak Army with the help of US
  - This was going on almost for 10 years, **Soviet-Afg War** ended in **1989**
  - USSR pull backs its troops and abandon the mission in Afg, **by 1991 USSR Collapse**
  - Now Mujahideen needed to only fight with thier own people with different ideology, So there is no terror business for Pak
  - US stops funding Pak, big loss of Pak Army
  - **Al-Qeada headed by Osama, Mujahideens was brain washed** by Pak to fight against Corrupt islamic leaders and US presence in Islamic land
  - That was the time US wanted to thier ***presence in Middle East***
  
 - **1991 Gulf War, USA looks thiers benefits**
   - Coalition Forces from 35 nations led by **United states** against **Iraq** Oil pricing and Production Disputes
   - **Saddam Hussein** regime was became America first target in 1990s
   - Pak shown this an opportunities and  created **Al-Qaeda**
   - ***1996 when Pak Army created Taliban***, **Al-Qaeda** restablish its headquarter in Afg under the shadow of Taliban
   - 1997-1998, Al-Qaeda influence started expanding in African County\
    - US Ambecy attack in kenya and Tanjania, done by Al-Qaeda
   - Finally **9/11 attcks** happened US declared war on terror and took Al-Qaeda seriously
   - Pak sucessed to bring back USA in Afgan, this time directly by sending troops

   - If you sees the interview of Parvez Musaraf, he openly admitted that Pak Army & ISI had trained the Taliban and Al-Qaeda
    - Also said Osama Bin laden, Hakkami etc were heroes for Pak & CIA also
  
 ### Pak K1 mission Kashmir
- Militancy started in J&K in late 80s & early 90s that was the time of end of Soviet-Afg war
- It was Pak Army & ISI who created **Lashkar-e-Taiba**, **Jaish-e-Mohahmmad** etc these are nothing but affliated with **Al-Qaeda** & **Taliban**
- Pak Army & ISI are responsible to created **Riligious Militancy**
- They order them to do **Jihaad in kashmir** in the name of religion
- After analysing **Pakistan is the founding father of all this** but even **United States have to blamed for all this** after all they supplied Money & Equipments etc

> So, **Terrorism is the creation of both Pakistan as well as the indirect involvement of the West**
> **Noone says and admits it openely but ultimately This is the Truth**
